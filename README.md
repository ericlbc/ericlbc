My name is Eric, and I currently work as a developer at the <a href="https://portal.tcu.gov.br" target="_blank">Tribunal de Contas da União</a>, where I build and maintain web applications using Oracle APEX, leveraging SQL and PL/SQL as backend technologies. I hold the position of Federal External Control Auditor, and my work is focused on systems development.
</p>
<p>
I hold a bachelor’s degree in Aeronautical Infrastructure Engineering (<a href="http://www.ita.br" target="_blank">ITA</a>), as well as a master’s (<a href="https://ufpa.br" target="_blank">UFPA</a>) and a Ph.D. (<a href="http://www.ita.br" target="_blank">ITA</a>) in Computational Mechanics. My academic background provided me with a strong foundation in mathematics, numerical methods, and analytical problem-solving.
