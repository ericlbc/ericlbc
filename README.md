My name is Eric, and I currently work remotely as a developer at the <a href="https://portal.tcu.gov.br" target="_blank">Tribunal de Contas da União</a>, where I build and maintain web applications using <a href="https://catalog-education.oracle.com/ords/certview/sharebadge?id=D6C81C88572EF51EF31C223D53434E9BD219A36F676D3E472F8BC58D71FDF76B" target="_blank">Oracle APEX</a>, leveraging <a href="https://catalog-education.oracle.com/ords/certview/sharebadge?id=72BD2A2849B83EB939F9C9EE1D773C04BCC427E3D3B3257F703B719E39882308" target="_blank">SQL</a> and PL/SQL as backend technologies. I hold the position of Federal External Control Auditor, and my work is focused on systems development.

I hold a <a href="https://www.civil.ita.br/graduacao/egresso/egresso.php?Class=2004" target="_blank">bachelor’s degree</a> in Aeronautical Infrastructure Engineering from ITA, as well as a <a href="https://ppgec.propesp.ufpa.br/index.php/br/teses-e-dissertacoes/dissertacoes/50-2010" target="_blank">master’s degree</a> from UFPA and a <a href="http://www.bdita.bibl.ita.br/tesesdigitais/lista_resumo.php?num_tese=74055" target="_blank">Ph.D.</a> from ITA, both in the field of Computational Mechanics. My <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/4588925736473793" target="_blank">academic background</a> provided me with a strong foundation in mathematics, numerical methods, and analytical problem-solving.

My personal goal on this first semester is to acquire foundational knowledge in algorithms and programming.
