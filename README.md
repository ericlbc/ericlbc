I'm a first-semester Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.cesupa.br" target="_blank">Cesupa</a> with a strong interest in programming, game development and data science.

My name is Eric, and I currently work as a developer at the <a href="https://portal.tcu.gov.br" target="_blank">Tribunal de Contas da União</a>, where I build and maintain web applications using <a href="https://catalog-education.oracle.com/ords/certview/sharebadge?id=D6C81C88572EF51EF31C223D53434E9BD219A36F676D3E472F8BC58D71FDF76B" target="_blank">Oracle APEX</a>, leveraging <a href="https://catalog-education.oracle.com/ords/certview/sharebadge?id=72BD2A2849B83EB939F9C9EE1D773C04BCC427E3D3B3257F703B719E39882308" target="_blank">SQL</a> and PL/SQL as backend technologies. I hold the position of Federal External Control Auditor, and my work is focused on systems development.

I hold a bachelor’s degree in Aeronautical Infrastructure Engineering (<a href="http://www.ita.br" target="_blank">ITA</a>), as well as a master’s (<a href="https://ufpa.br" target="_blank">UFPA</a>) and a Ph.D. (<a href="http://www.ita.br" target="_blank">ITA</a>) in Computational Mechanics. My <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/4588925736473793" target="_blank">academic background</a> provided me with a strong foundation in mathematics, numerical methods, and analytical problem-solving.
</p>
<p>
My personal goal on this first semester is to acquire foundational knowledge in algorithms and programming.
